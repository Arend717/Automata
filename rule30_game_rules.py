# File: Rule30_GameRules.py
# This file contains the Rule 30 update logic

"""
This version only draws the bottom row (as you would in a Rule 30 visualization).

It uses a lookup table (dictionary) for the logic, as is common with Rule 30.

cells[-2] is the second-to-last row â€” the last row is calculated from it.
